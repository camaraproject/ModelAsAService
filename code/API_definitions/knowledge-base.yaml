  title: Knowledge Base
  description: >-
    This API offers comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) management capabilities for the knowledge base, along with document uploading functionality.
    It is designed to provide applications with standardized capabilities for knowledge content storage and management, supporting multi-format document storage, fine-grained permission control, and end-to-end traceability.
    It is suitable for building knowledge-intensive systems (such as intelligent customer service platforms and enterprise document platforms) while ensuring compliance.


    ## API Functionality

    This API allows API clients to perform CRUD operations on the knowledge base hosted on the server.

    ## Security and Authentication

    This API uses OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect for authentication. The following scopes are required:
    - knowledge-base:knowledge-bases:create - Create new knowledge bases
    - knowledge-base:knowledge-bases:read - Read knowledge base entries
    - knowledge-base:knowledge-bases:update - Update existing knowledge bases
    - knowledge-base:knowledge-bases:delete - Delete knowledge bases
    - knowledge-base:documents:update - Upload documents to knowledge bases

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.


    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.
