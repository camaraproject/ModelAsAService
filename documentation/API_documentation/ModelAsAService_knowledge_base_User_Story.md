# Model as a Service - Knowledge Base User Story

| Item                      | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| ***Summary***                   |As an application developer, I want to use a standardized API to create, manage, and populate knowledge bases with documents, so that I can build knowledge-intensive applications (like intelligent customer service or enterprise wikis) with fine-grained access control and full traceability. |
| ***Roles, Actor(s) and scope*** |**Roles:** Application Developer, API Consumer (Application Server)<br/>**Actors:** Application Service Provider, End-Users interacting with the knowledge-based application.<br/>**Scope:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) lifecycle management of knowledge base resources and document upload.|
| ***Pre-conditions***            |<ul><li>The API Consumer (application server) is onboarded to the CSP's API platform.</li><li>The API Consumer has successfully subscribed to the Knowledge Base API product.</li><li>The API Consumer has obtained a valid OAuth 2.0 access token with the required scopes for the intended operation (e.g., knowledge-base:knowledge-bases:create).</li></ul>             |
| ***Activities/Steps***          |Starts when: The API Consumer application server makes an authenticated API request (e.g., POST /knowledge-bases to create a new knowledge base).<br/>Ends when: The requested operation is completed by the API server and a success or error response is received (e.g., 201 Created for a successful creation).             |
| ***Post-conditions***           |The state of the knowledge base system is changed according to the operation (e.g., a new knowledge base is created and available, a document is added to a knowledge base, a knowledge base is deleted). The API consumer can proceed with its application logic.             |
| ***Exceptions***                |<ul><li>401/403 Unauthorized/Forbidden: Invalid, missing, or expired access token; lack of required OAuth scope.</li><li>400 Bad Request: Invalid input (e.g., missing required 'name' field, invalid document format).</li><li>404 Not Found: Referenced resource (e.g., knowledgeBaseId) does not exist.</li><li>415 Unsupported Media Type: Attempting to upload a document type not supported (e.g., not doc, pdf, txt, csv).</li><li>500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server during processing.</li></ul>             |
