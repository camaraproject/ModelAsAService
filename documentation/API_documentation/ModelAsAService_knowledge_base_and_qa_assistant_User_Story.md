| Item                      | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| ***Summary***                   |As an application development lead at a financial services company, I need to leverage a comprehensive set of knowledge management and intelligent Q&A APIs to transform our extensive financial product documentation, compliance guidelines, and customer service manuals into a smart Q&A system. This will enable our clients to quickly obtain accurate product information and compliance advice through natural language queries, while our customer service team can handle complex inquiries more efficiently. Ultimately, this will enhance customer satisfaction and reduce operational costs.|
| ***Roles, Actor(s) and scope*** |**Actors:** <br>• Financial Services Company:Development Lead - Decides on API integration and leads the development team<br/>• Financial Services Company:Development Team - Implements API integration<br/>• Financial Services Company:Customer Service Manager - Defines knowledge base content and Q&A requirements<br/>• Financial Services Company:Compliance Officer - Ensures content meets regulatory requirements<br/>• End Customer - End-user utilizing the intelligent Q&A functionality<br/>• Customer Service Representative - Uses the system to assist customer service<br/>• Communication Service Provider (CSP) - Provides the API platform and services<br/><br/> **Scope:** <br/>• Creation and management of multiple knowledge bases (e.g., "Investment Products," "Loan Services," "Compliance Guidelines")<br/>• Upload of documents in various formats (PDF product brochures, DOCX compliance documents, TXT FAQs, CSV data sheets)<br/>• Configuration of dedicated Q&A assistants for different scenarios (e.g., "Investment Advisor Assistant," "Loan Specialist Assistant")<br/>• Adjustment of large language model parameters to optimize answer quality and style<br/>• API queries to obtain intelligent answers based on the knowledge base<br/>• Tracking answer sources to ensure compliance and auditability|
| ***Pre-conditions***            |The following prerequisites must be met:<br/>1. Financial Services Company:Development Lead has evaluated and selected the CSP's API solution, and Customer Service Manager and Compliance Officer have confirmed requirements<br/>2. The company has subscribed to the Knowledge Base and Q&A Assistant API product package through the CSP's business portal<br/>3. Development Team has registered the company application on the CSP platform and obtained necessary credentials (e.g., client ID and secret)<br/>4. The company backend system has implemented the OAuth 2.0 client flow and can obtain access tokens with required scopes (e.g., knowledge-base:knowledge-bases:create, qa-assistant-service:answer:read)<br/>5. Compliance Officer has reviewed and approved the data processing plan to ensure compliance with financial industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS)|
| ***Activities/Steps***          |**Starts when:** The company decides to implement an intelligent Q&A system to improve customer service quality<br/><br/> **Typical implementation and usage process:** <br/>1. Knowledge Base Planning - Customer Service Manager and Compliance Officer jointly determine the scope and categorization of documents to be digitized<br/>2. Knowledge Base Creation - Development Team calls POST /knowledge-bases to create structured knowledge bases like "Investment Products" and "Loan Services"<br/>3. Document Upload - Use POST /knowledge-bases/{id}/documents to batch upload documents such as product brochures and compliance files<br/>4. Assistant Configuration - Create Q&A assistants for different scenarios via POST /assistants, setting specialized configurationPrompt to ensure answers comply with financial industry standards<br/>5. Model Tuning - Adjust largeModelParameters such as temperature and max_tokens based on Customer Service Manager feedback to balance answer creativity and accuracy<br/>6. System Integration - Integrate the Q&A API (POST /answer) into the company website, mobile apps, and customer service workstation<br/>7. Customer Query - End Customer asks questions through company channels, and the system uses the appropriate assistantId and user question as prompt to call the API<br/>8. Answer Generation - CSP service returns a response containing answerText and reference, ensuring answers are traceable to knowledge base sources<br/>9. Continuous Optimization - Regularly update knowledge base content and assistant configurations based on user feedback and customer service usage<br/><br/> **Ends when:** The customer receives accurate, helpful answers, and all interactions comply with regulatory requirements|
| ***Post-conditions***           |• The company maintains a continuously updated digital knowledge base containing all important financial product and compliance documentation<br/>• Multiple dedicated Q&A assistants are configured and capable of handling customer queries across different domains<br/>• Customers can quickly obtain accurate financial information through natural language without navigating complex documents<br/>• Customer service representatives can use the system to quickly respond to complex inquiries, improving work efficiency<br/>• All Q&A interactions are recorded and traceable to sources, meeting financial industry compliance and audit requirements<br/>• The system can be easily expanded as business grows, adding new knowledge bases and assistants|
| ***Exceptions***                |Potential exceptions and handling methods:<br/><br/>• 401 Unauthorized/403 Forbidden - Invalid access token or insufficient permissions (e.g., attempting to upload documents with read-only token). The system should reacquire a valid token or prompt the administrator to adjust permissions<br/>• 400 Bad Request - Input parameters do not meet requirements (e.g., missing knowledge base name, prompt exceeding 1000 characters, temperature parameter outside 0.0-1.0 range). Should validate inputs and provide clear error messages<br/>• 404 Not Found - Requested resource does not exist (e.g., using incorrect knowledge base ID or assistant ID). Should verify the correctness of resource identifiers<br/>• 415 Unsupported Media Type - Attempting to upload unsupported file formats. Should restrict upload file types and validate in advance<br/>• 500 Internal Server Error - Server-side processing error (e.g., LLM processing failure, document parsing error). Should log error details and implement retry mechanisms, while notifying administrators<br/>• Insufficient Answer Quality - Generated answers are inaccurate or incomplete. Should optimize by improving prompt engineering, adjusting model parameters, or enhancing knowledge base content<br/>• Response Delay - Q&A response time is too long, affecting user experience. Should consider implementing asynchronous processing or caching common answers<br/>• Compliance Risks - Answer content may involve compliance issues. Should establish manual review processes and content filtering mechanisms to ensure compliance with financial regulations|
