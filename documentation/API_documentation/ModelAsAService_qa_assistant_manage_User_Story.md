# Model as a Service - Q&A Assistant Manage User Story

| Item                      | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| ***Summary***                   |As an application developer, I want to use a standardized API to create, configure, and manage intelligent Q&A assistants based on Large Language Models (LLMs), so that I can build customizable intelligent customer service or question-answering systems with fine-grained control over model behavior, knowledge sources, and prompting strategies. |
| ***Roles, Actor(s) and scope*** |**Roles:** Application Developer, API Consumer (Application Server)<br/> **Actors:** Application Service Provider, End-Users interacting with the Q&A service. <br/>**Scope:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) lifecycle management of Q&A assistant configurations, including LLM parameter tuning, knowledge base association, and prompt engineering.|
| ***Pre-conditions***            |<ul><li>The API Consumer (application server) is onboarded to the CSP's API platform. </li><li>The API Consumer has successfully subscribed to the Q&A Assistant Management API product. </li><li>The API Consumer has obtained a valid OAuth 2.0 access token with the required scopes for the intended operation (e.g., qa-assistant-manage:assistants:create).</li></ul>|
| ***Activities/Steps***          |**Starts when:** The API Consumer application server makes an authenticated API request (e.g., POST /assistants to create a new assistant with specified LLM parameters and prompts).<br/> **Ends when:** The requested operation is completed by the API server and a success or error response is received (e.g., 201 Created with a generated assistantId).|
| ***Post-conditions***           |The state of the Q&A assistant system is changed according to the operation (e.g., a new assistant configuration is created and available, an existing assistant's parameters are updated). The API consumer can use the configured assistant for intelligent question-answering.|
| ***Exceptions***                |<ul><li>401/403 Unauthorized/Forbidden: Invalid, missing, or expired access token; lack of required OAuth scope; token context inconsistency.</li><li>400 Bad Request: Invalid input (e.g., missing required parameters like name or configurationPrompt, parameter values like temperature outside allowed range 0.0-1.0).</li><li>404 Not Found: Referenced resource (e.g., assistantId) does not exist.</li><li>500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server during processing (e.g., assistant creation or update failure).</li></ul>|
